# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Shifra-Advaced-Virtual-Assistent:-


Shifra is an intelligent, AI-powered virtual assistant built with **React.js**, capable of understanding and executing real-time voice commands. It combines the power of **speech recognition**, **text-to-speech**, and **dynamic task handling** to deliver a seamless, hands-free user experience.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 **Voice Recognition** — Start speaking with a single click. Real-time speech recognition using the Web Speech API.
- 💬 **AI-Powered Responses** — Integrates with Gemini to fetch smart answers for general queries.
- 🕒 **Time & Date Announcements** — Ask "what's the time" or "what's the date" and get an instant spoken reply.
- 🌐 **Smart Navigation & Search**:
  - Open or close websites like YouTube, Google, Instagram, etc.
  - Search Google or YouTube with your voice.
- 🔉 **Volume Control** — Adjust system voice volume using commands like:
  - "volume up"
  - "mute"
  - "unmute"
- 👤 **User Memory** — Remembers your age if you say: "My age is 22", and recalls it when asked.
- 🧠 **Multi-Command Handling** — Supports multiple commands in one sentence (e.g., "open YouTube and search cats").
- 🧹 **Context Reset** — Refreshing the page clears previous prompts.
- 🔄 **"Listening..." Prompt** — Always speaks "Listening..." after completing a response to prompt the next command.
- 🎶 **YouTube Music** — Just say "Play [song] on YouTube".

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** (Frontend Framework)
